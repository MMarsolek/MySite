# MySite 
This site was created for a class project to test what I have learned and to teach me new things. I plan on updating it as my skills advance so I can show off my newest projects.  
## Building and Running
The site can be run by right clicking anywhere on the HTML page and clicking "Open in Default Browser". Or you can view the page by going to "https://mmarsolek.github.io/MySite/"

## Consideration
My intent behind the design of this website, was to practice using flexboxes and grids. One thing I had to consider during this project was figuring out the best way to display my work. I ended up using a grid to display images that are linked to my past projects. Each of these images are also accompanied by a short overview of the project. 

## Things I learned and problems I solved
- The use of flexboxes and grids helped to improve my skills with them. 
- Getting the sidebar to line up with the contents was a challenge that I solved using flexbxes. 
- I had to find a image that I could use as a banner with out distorting it and the figure out how to crop it down without taking up too much space. 
- Building this site helped to re-enforce the need for variables on the CSS side of things.
