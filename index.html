                    Full Stack developer leveraging a training content development background to build a more intuitive user experience on the web. Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from the University of Washington Coding, with newly developed skills in Java, JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. Known as an innovative problem solver passionate about learning new technologies and developing new skills. With each project, my aim is to expand my knowledge and provide the best possible user experience. I worked on a team of four to develop a single-page CRUD website that helps local users track their travel expenses and plan their dream trip. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web.
