                <p>
                    I am a self taught programmer that has experience with both frontend and backend development. I have multiple certificates from both LinkenIn Learning and Coursera courses. I also have a Google IT certificate and am currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp through University of Washington.
                    I started learning how to program while working as a Content Developer for the Maintenance and Engineering department at Alaska Airlines. In mid 2020 I had to resign from my position due to the pandemic and was able to dedicate my time to learning how to program full time.
